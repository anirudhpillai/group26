              <h4>RDF</h4>
              <p>
                Resource Descriptive Framework (RDF), is a data model and is the W3C standard
                for data interchange on the web. It is a way of organising data in graph form. </br>

                Data is stored in the form of triples. A triple is a statement of the form
                subject-predicate-object.<br/>

                RDF also has multiple serialization formats. The way a particular triple is is encoded, depends
                on the format. Some of the available formats are: Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML. RDF/XML was the initial standard
                but users now prefer to use something like Turtle which is more human friendly.<br/>

                A collection of these triples then represent a directed graph. RDF data can be stored
                in both relational databases and Triplestores.

                What choices were there and what are their strengths and weaknesses?
                We have to build a web based GUI so we had to use Javascript, HTML and CSS.
                We also looked at Elm but decided to stick with ES6 Javascript as we were familiar with it
                and had already built projects with it.
              </p>

              <h3>React</h3>
              <p>
                We decided to choose React to build our UI as the Component system which React is based on,
                will allow us to reuse most of our code. As the GUI will have similar looking pages for each node,
                we can use our components to handle these views.<br>

                We looked at Angular as well but ..... React also works better with Redux.
              </p>
              <h3>Redux</h3>
              <p>
                We will be using Redux as our application architecture framework
                Redux will help us write maintainable code and make our app very scalable.
                Using Redux will help us test our app easily as it is based
                on writing pure functions, which will make things easy to reason about.
                It also provides us with Time travelling debugger which works based on the state tree employed in Redux.
              </p>


              <h2>Tool Chain</h2>
              <ul class="slab">
                <li><b>ES6 with Babel: </b>  This will give us access to new and advanced features in Javascript</li>
                <li><b>Gulp:</b> for transpiling ES6</li>
                <li><b>Eslint:</b> for catching errors in our code and so that everyone on the team follows the recommended (Airbnb) style guide for ES6</li>
                <li><b>Webpack:</b> for bundling our dependencies</li>
                <li><b>Travis CI:</b> as a continuous integration tool which will run our tests whenever we push our code to Git</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We only have to build a front end and don't have to write a server.
                This means we don't have to use continous deployment, but we are still using Travis CI as it will automatically run our tests
                and let us know if it is safe to merge our changes from our development branch to the master branch.
