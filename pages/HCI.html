      <h2>HCI Principles</h2>

      <h4>Visibility</h4>
      <p>
        One of the most important HCI principles is visibility. Our RDF explorer places the controls in a highly visible location. People can see all possible operations when they traverse through the data in our app. For example, in the Classes page and the Instances page, the lists of classes or instances are shown obviously and people can find a search box easily from the top of the lists. Moreover, we show all information of a instance in the instance page from up to down. It is easily for users to familiar with the app structure.
      </p>

      <h4>Affordance</h4>
      <p>
        In the case of our app, we design the user interface with simple components (text, search box and relationship graph). Users can find the use of all components easily without any guides.
      </p>

      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>
        For the feedback part, our app will show warning information in the table if it hasn’t get any data from the database when an user using our app. Furthermore, for all clickable buttons and search boxes in our app, they have “click” animations for giving users feedback
      </p>

      <h4>Mapping</h4>
      <p>
        We have a good mapping in the case of our page control buttons.
(the screenshot of our page control buttons)
And also our navigation bar.
(the screenshot of our navigation bar)
      </p>

      <h4>Consistency</h4>
      <p>
        We have consistent UI throughout the whole app for users to operate. And also we keep the display of instances or resources information in a same way.
      </p>

      <h4>Constraints</h4>
      <p>
        There are no constraints in our app since we don’t need to prevent users from selecting incorrect options. We have tried to make it straightforward to use our app.
      </p>


      <h2>HCI Analysis</h2>
      <p>
      For the convenience of users that using our web application, we must guide them through each page and making the web application easy to use. This is also one of requirements from the client. Therefore we will use our human computer interaction knowledge to create an expected engineer to show how our application works and how we can improve our application.
      </p>
      <h3>Engineer:</h3>
      <p>
      John, A 25 years old engineer, he works in Bosch now. He has a lot of development experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario:</h3>
      <p>
      John is an engineer who works in Bosch and he tries to find the relationship of one particular node with others nodes. Then he uses the old application in his computer to find the special node. He opens the application and clicks the database that includes this node. Then he chooses the class that includes this node and then he clicks this node. However, the node information is not enough. John cannot find nodes that are related to this node and classes that the node belongs to. Moreover, John don’t remember what is the path that he clicks into the node and it confuses him.
      After that, he hears that there is a new website application created by some students in UCL. He enters this application and repeats these motions that he did in the old application.
      He finds the new application has a navigation bar to show where he is at real time and the navigation bar shows the path from the home page to the current page.
      In the node page, John can clearly find relative nodes information and the node page lists all classes that the node belongs to.
      The new application exactly meets the demand of John.
    </p>
    <h3>HCI Considerations:</h3>
    <p>
      Breadcrumbs trail (navigation bar): Our client has requested that the system must show users where he is and the path from the home page to the current page. The main feature from which that we will use is the navigation bar at the top of the page. This shows a directory tree of pages above the current one. For example, it could show Home > Database3 > Class 1 > Node 13 > Property 5.
    </p>


      <h2>Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
        You can see all the prototypes we developed and showed to the clients. For each prototype, there is a video, along with a short descriptive text,
        explaining the reasoning behind our design choices, the feedback we had from the prototype, and what we learned from it.
        We have also provided the code for our final prototype.
      </p>

      <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="../videos/Prototype1.mov" type="video/mp4">
          Prototype 1 video
      </video>
      <p>
        This is our first prototype. It shows a very simple way of traversing the data.

        You can see a list of every node, property, and class that exist in the whole database.

        By clicking on a node, you can see interesting details that concern it (the classes it belongs to,
        its properties). By clicking on a property, or a class, you can see every node that belong to that
        class / has that property.<br>

        This prototype contributed to our overall understanding of the project.
        It enabled us to have a common ground with the clients. As a consequence,
        our meeting/prototype presentation was very fruitful.

        For this prototype, we weren't focusing on how good the interface looked, we only wanted to
        demonstrate the funtionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="../videos/Prototype2.mov" type="video/mp4">
          Prototype 2 video
      </video>
      <p>
        After meeting with the clients and getting feedback on the first prototype, we decided to try out two different ideas. Each one is based on a different idea/need shared by the clients.
This is the first one. It was made to meet the need for a visual representation of the database and of the relationships that existed in it.

This prototype is based on a graphical representation of the nodes and their relationships. You can see that representation on the right side of the screen. When on a class’s page, you can see all the nodes that belong to it, and the relationships they all have between themselves.
When on a node’s page, you can see all the other nodes this one is connected to, along with its relationship with them.
      </p>

      <h2>Prototype 3</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="../videos/Prototype3.mov" type="video/mp4">
          Prototype 3 video
      </video>
      <p>
        This is the second idea we tried. This one was made to meet the need to see the “big picture”, of not getting lost in the database by knowing where you are.

This prototype is based on breadcrumbs, that show you your path, and what you visited before. You can click on those breadcrumbs to re-visit somewhere you’ve already been to. Each breadcrumb hides a dropdown, that shows you similar items. For example, a breadcrumb showing that you visited a certain class might give you the choice of visiting other classes in its dropdown.
