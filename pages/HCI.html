      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        You can see all the prototypes we developed and showed to the clients. For each prototype, there is a video, along with a short descriptive text,
        explaining the reasoning behind our design choices, the feedback we had from the prototype, and what we learned from it.
        We have also provided the code for our final prototype.
      </p>
      <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="../videos/Prototype1.mov" type="video/mp4">
          Prototype 1 video
      </video>
      <p>
        This is our first prototype. It shows a very simple way of traversing the data.

        You can see a list of every node, property, and class that exist in the whole database.

        By clicking on a node, you can see interesting details that concern it (the classes it belongs to,
        its properties). By clicking on a property, or a class, you can see every node that belong to that
        class / has that property.<br>

        This prototype contributed to our overall understanding of the project.
        It enabled us to have a common ground with the clients. As a consequence,
        our meeting/prototype presentation was very fruitful.

        For this prototype, we weren't focusing on how good the interface looked, we only wanted to
        demonstrate the funtionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="../videos/Prototype2.mov" type="video/mp4">
          Prototype 2 video
      </video>
      <p>
        After meeting with the clients and getting feedback on the first prototype, we decided to try out two different ideas. Each one is based on a different idea/need shared by the clients.
This is the first one. It was made to meet the need for a visual representation of the database and of the relationships that existed in it.

This prototype is based on a graphical representation of the nodes and their relationships. You can see that representation on the right side of the screen. When on a class’s page, you can see all the nodes that belong to it, and the relationships they all have between themselves.
When on a node’s page, you can see all the other nodes this one is connected to, along with its relationship with them.
      </p>

      <h2>Prototype 3</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="../videos/Prototype3.mov" type="video/mp4">
          Prototype 3 video
      </video>
      <p>
        This is the second idea we tried. This one was made to meet the need to see the “big picture”, of not getting lost in the database by knowing where you are.

This prototype is based on breadcrumbs, that show you your path, and what you visited before. You can click on those breadcrumbs to re-visit somewhere you’ve already been to. Each breadcrumb hides a dropdown, that shows you similar items. For example, a breadcrumb showing that you visited a certain class might give you the choice of visiting other classes in its dropdown.
