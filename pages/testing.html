        <h2>Comparison of alternatives and investigation of relevant available testing tools and methods.</h2>
        <p>
          In the end we had to decide between either Jest or Mocha for testing.
          Jest is a Javascript testing framework created by Facebook, who are also responsible for
          maintaining Redux and creating React. Moreover, it is also the recommeded testing framework
          for Redux. <br>
          While, Mocha is arguably the most popular Javascript testing framework for Node. It is very
          easy to use and has a lot more documentation and tutorials as it has been around for a really
          long time. Jest on the other hand is very new just like Redux. <br>
          We decided to go with Jest as it was created with React and Redux in mind and as it is also
          the recommended by the Redux community. All the examples in the Redux documentation also
          use Jest so we believe Jest will be the better option. <br>
          We will be using Circle CI as our continuous integration tool. We also looked at Travis CI and
          Jenkins. Travis is only free if your application is open source but we couldn't make our code accessible to
          the public. Meanwhile, Jenkins takes a lot more effort to set up and offers a lot more options. But, as we
          didn't need the extra options, we decided to choose Circle CI. <br>
          Circle CI is free for one project, and also gives us an interface to see our tests running in the container.
          It also allows us to SSH into the container to fix any problems with the container environment.
          Although we do not need continuous deployment, Circle CI also allows us to use scripts like Python Fabric
          to SSH into a remote server and deploy the application.
        </p>

        <h2>How automation can be achieved.</h2>
        <p>
          We can set up Circle CI to watch certain branches on our Git project. Whenever we push to a branch watched
          by Circle CI, it automatically gets the current code from the branch in a container and sets up our
          environment in the container. After this it runs our test script, which will be set up to run all our tests
          written in Jest. If all the tests pass, Circle CI will identify that the code in the branch is safe to
          be deployed or merged to the main branch. If tests don't pass it will alert us and give us details of the failing
          tests.
