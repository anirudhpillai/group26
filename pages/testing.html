      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Here, we propose our initial strategy for how to test our system.
We show how weâ€™ll approach our unit tests, but also our functional and integration tests. We have also looked at how
to perform user acceptance testing.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparison of alternatives and investigation of relevant available testing tools and methods.</h2>
      <p>
        After a lot of research into testing tools for Javascript, we had to decide between either Jest or Mocha for testing.
        Jest is a Javascript testing framework created by Facebook, who are also responsible for
        maintaining Redux and creating React. Moreover, it is also the recommeded testing framework
        for Redux. <br><br>

        While, Mocha is arguably the most popular Javascript testing framework for Node. It is very
        easy to use and has a lot more documentation and tutorials as it has been around for a really
        long time. Jest on the other hand is very new just like Redux. <br>
        We decided to go with Jest as it was created with React and Redux in mind and as it is also
        the recommended by the Redux community. All the examples in the Redux documentation also
        use Jest so we believe Jest will be the better option. <br>
        Moreover, Jest also allows us to test our code coverage without having to install any additionaly
        libraries. It has additional features like running tests in parallel to reduce test time.<br><br>

        Nightwatch.js will allow us to do functional and integration testing. Nightwatch works using the Selenium web drivers
        and provides a very extensive testing suite. By getting things to run in the browser, Nightwatch allows us
        to see how our different React and Redux components work together. This will help us do integration and functional testing.<br><br>

        We will be using Circle CI as our continuous integration tool. We also looked at Travis CI and
        Jenkins. Travis is only free if your application is open source but we couldn't make our code accessible to
        the public. Meanwhile, Jenkins takes a lot more effort to set up and offers a lot more options. But, as we
        didn't need the extra options, we decided to choose Circle CI. <br><br>

        Circle CI is free for one project, and also gives us an interface to see our tests running in the container.
        It also allows us to SSH into the container to fix any problems with the container environment.
        Although we do not need continuous deployment, Circle CI also allows us to use scripts like Python Fabric
        to SSH into a remote server and deploy the application.
      </p>

      <h2>User Acceptance Testing</h2>
      <p>
        User acceptance tests are conducted to see if the software is what the client expected.
        It is very important to conduct such tests, because otherwise there might easily be a rift
        between what the developers do and what the clients think they will get.
        <br><br>
        We decided to have UATs at every iteration of our app. Mistakes and misunderstandings would
        be detected early this way. This also ensures that at each step of our project, the clients
        know exactly what it will be like, and we know what to do. This gives them the opportunity
        to be involved and give constructive input, while it gives us valuable information on the
        project, as well as insight and feedback for future iterations.
      </p>

      <h2>How automation can be achieved.</h2>
      <p>
        We can set up Circle CI to watch certain branches on our Git project. Whenever we push to a branch watched
        by Circle CI, it automatically gets the current code from the branch in a container and sets up our
        environment in the container. After this it runs our test script, which will be set up to run all our tests
        written in Jest. If all the tests pass, Circle CI will identify that the code in the branch is safe to
        be deployed or merged to the main branch. If tests don't pass it will alert us and give us details of the failing
        tests.
