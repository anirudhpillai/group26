      <h2>System Manual</h2>

      <h4><a id="Develop_and_Contribute_0"></a>Develop and Contribute</h4>
      <p>This file helps you get up to date with the project by explaining how the code works, where to go to add/modify specific features etc…<br>
      We assume the prerequisites are already met.<br>
      Refer to <a href="http://README.md">README.md</a> to know how to have a local working copy of the project if not already.</p>
      <h4><a id="Set_up_6"></a>Set up</h4>
      <p>
        1. Clone the Project<br/>
        2. Run <code>npm install</code><br/>
        3. The GUI currently fetches the data from the deployed API with the test database.<br/>
        To change the URL for the API, go to <code>client/js/constants.js</code> and change the APIURL variable.<br/>
        4. Run <code>npm start</code>, which will start the GUI on port 3000. To change the port, you can edit, <code>devServer.js</code>.<br />
      </p>
      <h4><a id="Bundling_13"></a>Bundling</h4>
      <p>Install <code>webpack</code> globally using <code>sudo npm install -g webpack</code>.</p>
      <p>Then run <code>sh build.sh</code> to create a dist folder and a <code>bundle.js</code> file which contains the transpiled<br>
      React code.</p>
      <h4><a id="Built_With_19"></a>Built With</h4>
      <p>The main technologies used to build this are React and D3.js</p>
      <h4><a id="Testing_22"></a>Testing</h4>
      <p>Once you contributed, added or modified something, you can test your changes.<br>
      The command <code>npm test</code> will run a test suite with <em>Jest</em>.</p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> We use <a href="https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table">react-bootstrap-table</a> for our tables and our filter, that have been tested already.</p>

      <h2>User Documentation</h2>
      <h4>RDF Explorer - Bosch</h4>
      <p>RDF explorer is an web-based graphical user interface using a REST-API which supports engineers to traverse huge RDF datasets. &lt;/br&gt;<br>
      This tool is easy to use: to successfully uncover useful insights and traverse the database, engineers do not need to know anything about RDF or SPARQL queries. Our RDF explorer also has features that are absent from other similar tools.<br>
      Our main features:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <p>Our tool supports filtering and search (with the help of search bars for example).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Our tool has a navigation system that enables someone to traverse a database in a straightforward way, without getting lost (with the use of breadcrumbs for example).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Our tool gives ways of visualizing data and instances in a meaningful way (with the help of graphs).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Our tool gives insights on how data, instances, classes, nodes, are related and connected.</p>
      </li>
      </ol>

      <h4><a id="Getting_Started_20"></a>Getting Started</h4>
      <p>These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.</p>
      <h3><a id="Prerequisites_24"></a>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>What things you need to install the software and how to install them.<br>
      To use this Web-App, you first <a href="https://www.google.com" title="Installing Node">need to have Node</a> on your system.</p>
      <p>This tool can interface with any REST-API that implements some sort of RDF-graph. The URL of the API is <code>http://euve251515.serverprofi24.de:9090/rest-api-1.2/uclixn</code> for now. &lt;/br&gt;<br>
      To use a different API, change the URL located in <code>client/js/constants.js</code>.</p>
      <h3><a id="Installing_32"></a>Installing</h3>
      <p>A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.</p>
      <p>First <code>git clone https://github.com/anirudhpillai/rdf-explorer</code> our project, then navigate to the <code>.../rdf-explorer/GUI</code> folder.</p>
      <p>Then run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.</p>
      <p>Then run <code>npm start</code> and open localhost:3000 in your browser.</p>
      <p><em>NB:</em> It is important that you have the latest versions of <em>Node</em> and <em>npm</em> installed. You will get errors otherwise. You can check that with <code>npm -v</code> (version 3 or higher) and <code>node -v</code> (version 6 or higher).</p>
      <h4><a id="DevelopmentContributingProject_Documentation_44"></a>Development/Contributing/Project Documentation</h4>
      <p>Please read <em><a href="http://DEVELOPMENT.md">DEVELOPMENT.md</a></em> for details of how the code works and how to contribute.</p>
      <h4><a id="Features_48"></a>Features:</h4>
      <p>When first arriving on <code>localhost:3000</code>, you should see something like this:<br>
      <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/Screen_ClassList.png" alt="image"><br>
      The main page links to all the classes that exist in the RDF-database. you can sort them through regexpressions.</p>
      <p>Clicking on a class brings you to a page showing you all its instances. Again, you can sort those instances through regex.<br>
      <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/Screen_InstanceList.png" alt="image"></p>
      <p>Clicking on an instance shows you additional information on it. Namely, you can see a graph showing all of that instance’s relations with classes, properties, and other instances.<br>
      Clicking on such a node brings additional information.<br>
      <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/Screen_InstanceGraph.png" alt="image"></p>
      <p>Scrolling down, you can see two tables (that can be sorted and filtered), showing a list of all related instances and a list of all related values respectively.<br>
      <img class="responsive-img" src="../img/Screen_InstanceTables.png" alt="image"></p>
      <p>You can click on the breadcrumbs to go back to a previous state in the graph traversal.</p>

                    The client set up a Skype for Business call with us to give us an overview of the project. We spoke to Daniel Ewert and Steffen Stadtmüller. We found out the initial requirements and the client also added us to a Gitlab repo.

                    We spoke to Daniel Ewert and found out that they were going to provide us with a running instance of the API so that we won’t have to build it locally. They also said that the first draft of our requirements would look very much like the Sta srdog GUI. Additionally they would also want the ability to selectubsets of properties or individuals and the ability to provide a direct link pointing to the selected data.
                    We also decided to use Gitlab for general communication

They also mentioned things they liked about the navigation, and things we should look at, like avoiding dead ends. They also talked about the need for documentation (both for users and developers).

                    We informed the client about the progress we had made on the documentation and the improvements to the navigation system. We also informed him that we will start working on statistics once the navigation system is complete.

                    The client gave us feedback on our newly implemented statistics view and also our completed navigation system. They also gave us ideas for some new features to add to the GUI like, computing shortest paths between two linked instances, calculating more ‘deeper’ statistics.

      <h2>Plans for Term 2</h2>
      <img src="../img/term2.png" alt="gannt chart" class="responsive-img"/>
      <p class="text">
        This Gantt chart shows how we hope the second term will be organised.
        We should point that like any plan, this might be changed according to the needs of the moment.
        This provides a framework of what we hope to do, for how long, and in what order.
        The time units are arbitrary: They show how much time we predict we'll spend on each task proportionally.
        This distinction is important: This doesn't tell us exactly how many weeks a task will take, but how long
        it is compared to other tasks. We think this variation is more adapted to the nature of our project
        because of the presence of several uncertainties (After how many iterations will we have something satisfiable?
        How many unexpected hurdles will there be?). <br>
        We will start by implementing our final prototype. We will organise the prototype into Redux and React components
        and go on to implement them. We will follow a test driven approach and will integrate Circle CI to run our
        tests whenever we push our code to the master branch.
