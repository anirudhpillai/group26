      <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
      <h4>Decorator Design Pattern</h4>
      <p>
        React has a feature called called Higher order components. You can write a function
        which takes in a React component and returns a new React component with some new
        functionalities and props attached to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is very useful as it gives us control over what props we need to pass to the
        component which is being decorated.
      </p>
      <h4>Dependency Injection</h4>


      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <h4>Class Diagram</h4>
      <p>
        At first glance it seems that our architecture makes heavy use of
        composition. But, it is only because it is highly recommened in React (our design
        framework) and is also considered a good practise. We have also explained below
        why React Favours Composition over Inheritance. We have done our best to adhere to
        industy standards which designing the system and we believe we succeeded as the
        application works flawlessly even when we load tested it.
      </p>

      <h4>Description of Classes</h4>

      <h4>React: Composition vs Inheritance</h4>
      <p>
        As React has a very powerful composition model, Facebook (creators of React)
        recommend to use Composition over Inheritance to reuse code between components.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our project we had two similar list views as two different components (InstanceList and ClassList).
        There was a lot of similar code in both the components as both were basically just list view showing
        different items. We initially thought of creating a abstract class for a List View but after reading
        the React documentation and recommendations we decided to go for composition over inheritance.
        <i>'Favour composition over inheritance'</i> &nbsp; is also a design principle in
        Head First Design Patterns book.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we used a separate Table component which had all the necessary code for the list view and then added
        this table component in both of our list views. Hence, avoiding duplication and promoting code reuse.
      </p>

      <h2>Development: Workflow</h2>
      <h4>Git Branching Model</h4>
      <p>
        We followed a really successfull git branching model. Whenever one of us
        was working on a feature for the GUI, we would create a separate branch to work on it
        and would them make a pull request when we thought the feature was ready. <br/>
        Also, our pull requests cannot be merged without a review, so one other team member
        would then check the new branch and then approve the changes to be merged into our
        master branch. Below is a screenshot of one of our pull requests being inspected.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/approve_pull_request.png" class="responsive-img" alt="" />

      <p>
        The video below aims to show the network visualisation of our branching model.
        You can clearly see the different features branches being merged into the master branch
      </p>

      <h2>Milestones</h2>
      <p>
        We tried to incrementally move forward while developing the GUI.
        Now we aim to show you how the development actually progressed and videos of
        the GUI at each stage.

      <p>
        As you can see in the video above, we implemented a data visualisation
        to show all connected instances and values.
      </p>

      <p>
        We added search for instances and classes and also tried to group
        nodes in the visualisation according to properties.
        We also did some load testing in which helped us figure that our search implemenation
        was breaking when we simulated a million instances. We took note of this and in
        the next milestone corrected it by changing our implementation to be able to
        handle a million connected nodes.

      <p>
        We changed our search implementation so that it work really fast even when
        there are millions of rows of data. We also styled our GUI and added some advanced filtering
        mechanisms. We also improved the page showing details of an instance (instance view) to show
        all linked instances and values in table which allows the user to filter them.
