      <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
      <h4>Adapter</h4>
      <p>
        Implementing our data visualisation was one of the hardest tasks on the project.
        This is because of the difficutly in getting D3.js (data visualisation
        library we were using) to work with React. D3.js works by creating a lot of
        DOM nodes for the graph and then doing calculations to place the nodes at
        the right place. But, React uses a virtual DOM to render components. Thus, D3.js
        can't really move elements on the DOM if the DOM doesn't exist.
        <br><br>
        So we had to write an Adapter to make D3.js work in React and successfully implement
        our data visualisation. We dug into the React source code to find some methods that
        the we needed and then we wrote our Graph Component. We used an adapter in between
        the D3.js which we put in the Graph component. The way the adapter worked was
        by first letting the entire React rendring process to complete and then after
        running the D3.js code from inside our Graph component.
        <br><br>
        This worked perfectly and our data visualisation works flawlessly because of this.
      </p>

      <h4>Dependency Injection</h4>
      <p>
        Dependency Injection helps implement Inversion of Control. React allows us to use
        dependency injection by passing props to a component. We use it extensively through out
        app expecially in all our filtering tables. Instead of having to fetch the data by
        calling the API again and again, we make the parent components pass the data
        about instances (the dependency) to the child component throught props.
        Even in our Graph component, instead of having to call the API to update the component
        information, we just pass it the updated information from the Instance component which
        has already fetched the updated information.
      </p>

      <h4>Command</h4>
      <p>
        The render() method in React is synonymous to the execute() method in the Command pattern.
        Every React Component has a render() method and that's the only method which is required for
        a method to be displayed on the DOM.
        <br><br>
        This is used internally in React everywhere. So whenever the props of a component change, it knows
        it only needs to call the render() method to update the component on the page. This powerful
        abstraction also allows the component to be changed easily as the calling function only
        needs to know to call the render() method (which every component has) without needing
        to know anything else about the calling component.
      </p>

      <h4>Observer</h4>
      <p>
        The observer pattern is used extensively in React where the props of an object are
        passed around.
        One place where this happens is when the props of a child component change, not only does
        the child component re-render but also the parent components reder method is called again.
        <br><br>
        We use this feature extensively, especially in our Graph component for the datavisualisation.
        When ever the current viewing instance changes, the graph method automatically re-renders to show
        the visualisation for the new instance. The signal to re render the graph component comes from
        the change in its props where the original JSON containing the nodes and links is replance with new
        JSON which has nodes and links for the new instance.
      </p>

      <h4>Decorator Design Pattern</h4>
      <p>
        React has a feature called called Higher order components. You can write a function
        which takes in a React component and returns a new React component with some new
        functionalities and props attached to it.
        <br><br>
        This is very useful as it gives us control over what props we need to pass to the
        component which is being decorated. We use this in our Main component to make it
        comply with React Router and handle our Routing mechanism. We also use this to
        implement advace filtering capabilities in our filtering table.
      </p>

      <h4>Component Based Architecture</h4>
      <p>
        React can easily be called held responsible for ending the use of MVC on the
        front-end. We make heavy use of components in React. <br>
        Component = Views + Event Handling + UI State <br>
        So each component manages its own state and event handling, thus, obviating
        the need for MVC and providing a much better separation of concerns.
      </p>


      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <h4>Class Diagram</h4>
      <p>
        At first glance it seems that our architecture makes heavy use of
        composition. But, it is only because it is highly recommened in React (our design
        framework) and is also considered a good practise. We have also explained below
        why React Favours Composition over Inheritance. We have done our best to adhere to
        industy standards which designing the system and we believe we succeeded as the
        application works flawlessly even when we load tested it.
      </p>

      <h4>Description of Classes</h4>

      <h4>React: Composition vs Inheritance</h4>
      <p>
        As React has a very powerful composition model, Facebook (creators of React)
        recommend to use Composition over Inheritance to reuse code between components.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our project we had two similar list views as two different components (InstanceList and ClassList).
        There was a lot of similar code in both the components as both were basically just list view showing
        different items. We initially thought of creating a abstract class for a List View but after reading
        the React documentation and recommendations we decided to go for composition over inheritance.
        <i>'Favour composition over inheritance'</i> &nbsp; is also a design principle in
        Head First Design Patterns book.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we used a separate Table component which had all the necessary code for the list view and then added
        this table component in both of our list views. Hence, avoiding duplication and promoting code reuse.
      </p>

      <h2>Development: Workflow</h2>
      <h4>Git Branching Model</h4>
      <p>
        We followed a really successfull git branching model. Whenever one of us
        was working on a feature for the GUI, we would create a separate branch to work on it
        and would them make a pull request when we thought the feature was ready. <br/>
        Also, our pull requests cannot be merged without a review, so one other team member
        would then check the new branch and then approve the changes to be merged into our
        master branch. Below is a screenshot of one of our pull requests being inspected.
      </p>

        The video below aims to show the network visualisation of our branching model.
        You can clearly see the different features branches being merged into the master branch

      <h2>Milestones</h2>
      <p>
        We tried to incrementally move forward while developing the GUI.
        Now we aim to show you how the development actually progressed and videos of
        the GUI at each stage.

        We added search for instances and classes and also tried to group
        nodes in the visualisation according to properties.
        We also did some load testing in which helped us figure that our search implemenation
        was breaking when we simulated a million instances. We took note of this and in
        the next milestone corrected it by changing our implementation to be able to
        handle a million connected nodes.

        We changed our search implementation so that it work really fast even when
        there are millions of rows of data. We also styled our GUI and added some advanced filtering
        mechanisms. We also improved the page showing details of an instance (instance view) to show
        all linked instances and values in table which allows the user to filter them.
      </p>
